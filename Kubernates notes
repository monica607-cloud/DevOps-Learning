ts architecture follows a master-worker (or control plane-node) model, where the Control Plane manages the cluster, and Worker Nodes run the applications.
Control plane component (master node) - 
 API Server
Entry point for all commands (kubectl, REST).
Validates and configures data for the rest of the system.
Communicates with etcd, controllers, and nodes.

etcd
Key-value store (like a database) that stores all cluster data and configurations.
Stores state information like nodes, pods, secrets, config maps, etc.

Scheduler
Assigns newly created pods to available nodes based on resource needs, affinity rules, etc.

Controller Manager
Runs controllers that watch the cluster state and make changes:
Node Controller: Checks node health.
ReplicaSet Controller: Ensures the desired number of pod replicas.
Deployment Controller: Manages updates/rollbacks.
Job Controller, etc.
