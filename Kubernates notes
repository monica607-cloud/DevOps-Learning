What is kubernates?
Ans:- Kubernates is an opensource Platform design to automated Deploying scaling and oprating application container.

Explain kubernate architature?
Ans:- Kubernetes is an open-source container deployment and administration platform
ts architecture follows a master-worker (or control plane-node) model, where the Control Plane manages the cluster, and Worker Nodes run the applications.
Control plane component (master node) - 
 API Server
Entry point for all commands (kubectl, REST).
Validates and configures data for the rest of the system.
Communicates with etcd, controllers, and nodes.

etcd
Key-value store (like a database) that stores all cluster data and configurations.
Stores state information like nodes, pods, secrets, config maps, etc.

Scheduler
Assigns newly created pods to available nodes based on resource needs, affinity rules, etc.

Controller Manager
Runs controllers that watch the cluster state and make changes:
Node Controller: Checks node health.
ReplicaSet Controller: Ensures the desired number of pod replicas.
Deployment Controller: Manages updates/rollbacks.
Job Controller, etc.

Worker Node Components
kubelet
Agent running on each node.
Ensures the containers are running in the pod as expected.
Talks to the container runtime (e.g. Docker)

kube-proxy
Maintains networking rules on each node.
Handles communication between services and pods (load-balancing, routing).

 Container Runtime
Runs the containers.
]Examples: Docker, containerd, CRI-O.

 Pods
Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
Can contain one or more containers.
Managed by Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, etc.

3 . Explain the concept of Container Orchestration?
Container orchestration is the automated process of deploying, managing, scaling, networking, and monitoring containers.
