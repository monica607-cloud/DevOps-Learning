difference between application load balancer and network load balancer

Application Load Balancer (ALB)
	Layer 7 (Application Layer)
HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
Advanced: path-based, host-based, headers, query strings
Good for web apps, but adds some latency
Web applications, microservices (e.g., routing /api, /images)
IP Target Support	Yes
TLS Termination	Yes (at the load balancer)
Health Checks	HTTP/HTTPS-based
Static IP	No (uses DNS name)
Pricing	Based on LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units)

Network Load Balancer (NLB):-
Layer 4 (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP)
Protocols Supported:-TCP, TLS, UDP
Basic: IP and port-based routing
Ultra-low latency, high performance
Real-time applications, high-speed workloads (e.g., gaming, VoIP)
IP Target Support :- Yes (great for IP-based targets, like appliances)
TLS Termination :-Yes (if needed), or pass-through to the target
Health Checks TCP or HTTP-based
Yes (can assign Elastic IPs)
pricing Based on hours and data processed


Yes (if needed), or pass-through to the target
