EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Type: Block Storage.

Use Case: Primarily for attaching storage volumes to EC2 instances.

Structure: EBS volumes act like hard drives that you can attach to a server, like a traditional disk drive.

Access: Can only be mounted to a single EC2 instance at a time (though you can create snapshots or back up data).

Performance: Offers high-performance storage, optimized for workloads that require low latency and high IOPS (Input/Output operations per second), such as databases.

Scaling: Can be resized and modified easily.

Cost: Generally, EBS is pay-as-you-go, based on the amount of storage and I/O performance.

 EFS (Elastic File System)
Type: File Storage.

Use Case: A shared file system for multiple EC2 instances to access simultaneously.

Structure: EFS works like a traditional file system, where multiple machines can mount and read/write to it concurrently.

Access: It is accessible to multiple EC2 instances at the same time and supports NFS (Network File System) protocols.

Performance: Scales automatically as data is added, with varying performance levels (standard or infrequent access).

Scaling: Auto-scaling in terms of storage capacity, as it adjusts to the amount of data without needing manual intervention.

Cost: Based on the amount of storage used and the performance mode selected.

3. Normal Server (On-Premise/Traditional Server)

Type: Typically a physical server with local storage (HDD or SSD).

Use Case: Standard servers where all the storage, processing, and file system management are local to the machine itself.

Structure: The server has a fixed amount of local storage attached directly to it.

Access: Can only be accessed by the server itself (or through network shares if configured).

Performance: Performance depends on the hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O). Scaling requires manual upgrades (e.g., adding more storage or upgrading the hardware).

Scaling: Scaling is limited and can be expensive since it may require adding more hardware.

Cost: Typically higher upfront costs for hardware and maintenance, but no ongoing cost unless you need to scale.
