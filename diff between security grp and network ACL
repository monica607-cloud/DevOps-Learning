difference between security group and network ACL

SECURITY GROUP :-

In security group, we operate at instance level.
It support only allow rules.
It is stateful, when we create an inbound or an outbound rule.
We cannot block specific IP address using SGs.
All rules are evaluated before deciding to permit trffic.
It start with instance launch configuration.
It applies when someone specifies security group when launching the instance and it associates with security group.

NETWORK ACL :-
In network ACL, we operate sub net level.
It support allow rules and deny rules.
It is stateless, it return traffic must be allowed explicitly.
We can block specific IP Address using NACL.
Rules are processed in number order when deciding whether allow traffic.
In which we assigned to subnet for all instance.
